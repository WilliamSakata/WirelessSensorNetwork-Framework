Compiling for:
==============

#ANDROID:
 To compile this code to work in linux x86 or x64, set variable "CPATH" for "include" 
and "include/linux" directory in JAVA (JDK) folder tree and just use make command to build.

 To compile this code to work in android, you will need the 
android source code:
	- change variable "CPATH" in "android_cfg_build.sh" for "include" and "include/linux" directory in java folder tree 
	- change variable "TOP" in "android_cfg_build.sh" and "android_copy.sh" for android source code
	- run "source android_cfg_build.sh"
	- use "mm" command to compile the code
	- use "android_copy.sh" to copy binarys from android tree code
	
.:_*_:. If use "mm clean" command, remove all the duplicate folders in android root folder that there are at android/external


#PYTHON:
 To compile the REP Module for Python, unpack the RepaModule-X.X.tar.gz, enter in the folder RepaModule-X.X and use the following commands:
